Nowadays the use of technology has grown more and more, and despite the great benefits it is necessary to pay attention to the damage it causes. Specifically about the danger of Bias in machine learning, a problem that has been recurring in recent years, which consists of programs that are not prepared to identify all people or are influenced to make different decisions depending on how they were trained.

We have more and more data to use. Which can be images of the photos we take, use in social networks, e-commerce, automation in the industries ... and with that, several products have used this technology in a discriminated way. In addition, as it is recent, there aren't adequate regulations everywhere that would prevent its use. Thus, society ends up being subject to the risks that errors in the development of technologies can cause.

As part of the technology community, I feel that the issues of inclusion end up being downgraded in development or sometimes it is not something that those involved in the project are concerned with. In addition, the technologies developed tend to reflect what those who develop think, so we can create technologies that are not suitable for everyone, and that may end up reflecting the discrimination that we have in society, even if it is not that intention.

The idea of ​​the playground is to reflect on the dangers that technology can cause. First, the user learns what machine learning is, with its steps. Then it is possible to simulate the training of a machine learning model for detecting people in photos, through the use of a dataset. The user will be able to choose the dataset (image bank) that will be used and the result will be tested on the spot.

In the end, a reflection is promoted about the danger that technologies that have been badly implemented can cause if they are not developed to include everyone, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic.

For the development of the Playground, SpriteKit and Swift 5.3 were used. Some animations are presented and the user participates in a machine learning training experience by dragging the photos to the machine being trained, and then takes a quiz.
